        <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
        <ul class="lists">
            <li>400g plain flour, plus extra to dust</li>
            <li>1 x 7g sachet fast action dried yeast</li>
            <li>1 tsp fine sea salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to drizzle</li>
            <li>1 tbsp cornmeal, polenta or semolina, to roll out</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps: </h2>
        <ol class="lists">
            <li>Preheat the oven to the hottest it will go (around 240°C, fan 220°C, gas 9), before starting to make the dough.</li>
            <li>Mix the flour, yeast, salt and sugar together in a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the centre and add the oil, then add about 225ml water to bring together as a dough.</li>
            <li>Tip out onto a floured surface and knead for 1 minute, just until smooth.</li>
            <li>Leave to rest under the upturned bowl while you prepare your pizza toppings.</li>
            <li>It's time to shape the pizzas! Roll out one ball at a time on a lightly floured surface, to about 25cm in diameter.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a large square of baking paper with the cornmeal (or alternative) then lift the dough onto the paper.</li>
            <li>Stretch and press the pizza dough with your fingertips until it is about 30cm diameter, indenting a thicker crust around the edges. The middle should be about 5mm, and the crust about 1cm deep. Repeat to make a second pizza.</li>
            <li>Spread the pizzas with sauce and add your toppings (don't add too many, or you'll end up with a soggy pizza).</li>
            <li>Drizzle with a little oil and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes before baking, so that the dough starts to rise.</li>
            <li>Slide the pizzas onto the preheated pizza stones or hot baking trays, still on the lining paper to help lift them easily.</li>
            <li>Bake for 10-15 minutes until the base is golden and crisp.</li>
        </ol>
